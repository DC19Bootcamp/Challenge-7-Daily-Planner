# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

The aim of the challenge was to produce an interactive work day scheduler that had local storage enabling data to be stored on the page. Due to time constraints and overlapping tasks I have not successfully worked out the issue with Jquery but will attempt over the next few days. 

I have successfully, however, created the page layout, intergrated moment so that the time displays in the header and wrote the code for JS. But still getting a jquery issues. Im close but need more time.
